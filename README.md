# Title

# Abstract
In the past years, we became more and more bombarded by information from
multiple sources thanks to the rise of the Internet. The huge amount of
information we have at our fingertips and the freedom of the online world
comes unfortunately with the downside of corrupted information,
misinterpretations or plain lies. We believe that being able to tell the truth
from a lie has become a key ability. Using the Liar dataset, we plan to
identify key features of lies and measure their spread in the online world,
therefore making an analysis of the most reliable online medium, on how the
misinformation spreads and on markers of untruthful statements.

# Research questions
- Which is the more reliable, Facebook or Twitter?
- Which are the topics that tend to have the most lies?
- What are features of lies? Does the positivity of a statement make it more
or less likely to be a lie? Are feelings somehow involved?

# Dataset
List the dataset(s) you want to use, and some ideas on how do you expect to get, manage, process and enrich it/them. Show us you've read the docs and some examples, and you've a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant.
