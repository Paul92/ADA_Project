The advent of internet and the tremendous interconnectivity it created between
people comes with the downside of less checks for the validity of the
information. Nowdays everyone can have a website and share information, without
restrictions on the content quality.

Understanding the lying patterns in order to be able to detect lies is a very
difficult task. More research in natural language processing is needed, as well
as more psychological studies and data. In this project, we take a small step
in this direction, performing analysis of labelled political statements.

Politics is a very widely debated topic and it has a direct impact on people's
lives. Most of modern states in Europe and North America are based on
representative democracy, where vital decisions regarding the future of the
country are taken by representatives chosen thorugh vote. Trusting those people
is therefore vital, but not an easy task. There is a strong incentive of
deforming the truth or lying in the election campain to gain more votes or
during their mandate in order to keep a position of power.

Another related problem of the modern society are the fake news. Media
companies strive to create high impact news, not always reporting the truth.

In this project, we perform an analysis of the Liar dataset, a dataset of
political statements from [politifacts](http://www.politifact.com), looking
at cues for determining the truthfulness of a statement. We also experiment
with some machine learning models to get more insight into the data and
extrapolate it to new statements.

## The Liar dataset

A great challenge for deception detection is the lack of a large amount of
labelled data. We have used for our analysis the
[Liar dataset (Wang, 2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.00648).
This is, to the best of our knowledge, the one of the biggest labelled datasets
of statements labelled according to their truthfulness.

Unfortunately, while the dataset provides a lot of information regarding the
context of the statement, the reasons for which it received a certain truth
classification and 6 classes of truth, it has only about 12000 entries. The
relatively low number of entries, as well as the predominance of statements
from the US politics, does not allow for a good generalization. However, there
is enough data for an analysis of the lies in the US politics from the past
decade.


#### The political language

Since we are dealing with natural language, we decided to start our analysis
by examining the vocabulary present in the dataset. Since the statements share
the same language and the same field, we expect a similar word distribution
over the classes, but we are interested if some words tend to have a higher
usage in a particular class.

This is a relatively small dataset, with a body of almost 190 000 words.
However, with and almost 12 000 unique tokens (we count 'home' and 'homes'
as 2 different tokens), has a variate vocabulary, many words appearing just
once or twice. For comparison, a publication by Laufer et al, 2010, indicates
that understanding 8000 word families leads to a 98% vocabulary coverage in
average English spoken discourse, with as little as 3000 word families (5000
lexical items) necessary for a minimal reading comprehension (Laufer (1992),
Adolphs (2003)). Note that these publications talk about word families and
lexical items, while we count tokens. Still, it provides a good intuition of
the size of the vocabulary represented in the dataset.

Looking at the most common words in the dataset, we can observe the main topics
of discussion in the politics at the time, such as health care or Barack
Obama, as well as some features of the political speech, such as the prevalence
of percents or years. Also, topics of interests for politics such as bill,
vote or government are present amongst the most used words in this dataset.

Although the dataset has 6 levels of truth, we take a look at the language
used in true and false statements in general, looking for differences in word
usage.

![Wordcloud true](assets/wordcloud_true.png)

We can make a few remarks on the words usage. The word 'million' is more used
in true statements, while the word 'billion' is more used in false statements.
This can suggest a tendency of exaggeration. Also, 'percent' tends to be less
used in false statements, possibly indicating a tendency in the lack of
precision. 'Health care', 'obamacare' and 'Barack Obama' are also more present
in untruthful statements. This is an interesting fact - since a large part of
the dataset overlaps with the Barack Obama's presidency, health care being
a controversial topic at the time.
